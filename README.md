# InfiniteScroll
A basic web app, mimicking the infinite scrolling characteristic.
- Fetching JSON data of images from [Unsplash Api](https://unsplash.com/documentation/).
- Dynamic insertion of a few images on load & more when the user scrolls down past the last 1000 pixels of the page.
- A slight effort into responsivity for smaller devices using CSS media query.
